# Globalshala-Campaigns

## Introduction
GlobalShala is a talent multiplier dedicated to empowering young professionals through mentorship, resources, and career-launching opportunities. As part of their mission, they organized Superhero U, a global competition designed to inspire innovation and creativity in solving real-world challenges aligned with the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). To promote the event, the Marketing team ran multiple Facebook ad campaigns. 

## Problem Statement
The Marketing team at GlobalShala needs to reduce costs by discontinuing at least one underperforming Facebook ad campaign for the Superhero U event. I have to analyze as part of  a team of analysts, the campaign performance data, assess key metrics, and recommend the least cost-effective campaign for discontinuation. 

## Data Sources
The Marketing team at GlobalShala provided a cleaned and organized dataset- [Marketing_data](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JQ1KKG-A8WMgHHHvkyP7zBFiToj2W5pA/view?usp=sharing) containing performance metrics for various Facebook ad campaigns promoting the Superhero U event. The dataset contained **16** cloumns and **34** rows. Attached is the description of each field in the dataset provided: [Description_brief](https://github.com/Rikky101/Globalshala-Campaigns/blob/main/Description%20Brief.docx) 


**First thing! I created a copy of the original datasets as backup.**

  
## Analysis and Visualization
 The provided data was analyzed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of each campaign in reaching and engaging the target audience by focusing on key performance indicators, including cost per click, cost per result, reach, impressions and unique click through rate.

Visualizations, including bar charts and scatter plots, were used to showcase the underperforming campaigns recommended to discontinue to the marketing team. This can be viewed in the dashboard created: [Globalshala_dashboard](https://github.com/Rikky101/Globalshala-Campaigns/blob/main/Globalshala%20Dashboard.pbix). In addition, a powerpoint presentation was created to highlight key insights, visualized data trends, and our final recommendation [Campaign_analysis_presentation](https://github.com/Rikky101/Globalshala-Campaigns/blob/main/Globalshala%20campaign%20Ad%20analysis%20Presentation%20.pdf)


## Conclusion and Recommendation
After carefully evaluating the key metrics, discontinuing campaign 3 & 10 was recommended, as it exhibited low cost per result amongst other campaigns. By removing this underperforming campaigns, the Marketing team can allocate resources more efficiently, reducing costs while maintaining overall outreach and engagement.
